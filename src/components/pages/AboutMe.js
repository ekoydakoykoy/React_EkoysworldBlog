            A Filipino (Cebuano) solo traveler with an extreme desire of exploring a wonderful, interesting and significantly new world. 
            Who travel in an inexpensive way and think that there is always a cheaper way to anything. 
            Seeing the different sides of the world and what the world can offer.
            The idea of getting lost always a thrill and amuse me for it is when you're lost you found yourself.
